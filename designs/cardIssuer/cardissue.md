Need help with system design interview

I am senior android native app developer who needs help preparing for an upcoming interview, specifically system design stage which will be backend focused.

I am looking for an experienced backend developer or a software architect who could jump on a 1 hour call with me, share his screen, design a specific system on Excalidraw and teach me about required components, performance improvements, bottlenecks and etc.

Here is the feature I want to prepare for:

Using Excalidraw, design a debit card issuing system using a 3rd party API that will handle card printing and delivering. 

Given amount of time for this in my interview will be only 45min. So I dont expect to design entire system, focus will be on core functionality for satisfying the defined requirements.

System will involve things like client, api gateway, databases, load balancers, cdn network, cache, sharding and adress other things like scalability, reliability and so on.

Structure is this:
1. Define functional and non-functional requirements
2. Draw high level diagram
3. Define entities (tables)
4. Define apis (parameters, requests, responses)
5. Do a deep dive (satisfy non-functional requirements, improve performance, identify and fix bottlenecks and etc.)

Has anyone recently participated in a System Design interview stage for Revolut?

Long story short I have an upcoming system design interview at Revolut and would appreciate insights from those who've recently gone through it.

From my research, in the 1-hour interview I will need to cover:

High-Level Design:
- Gathering functional/non-functional requirements
- System components (client, server, DB, cache and others)
- Scaling solutions (like sharding)
- Performance optimization (like CDN for latency or load balancing)
- Basic security considerations (auth, SSL, encryption)

Low-Level Design:
- Application layers
- Define Basic API structure/design
- Define Basic Database schema
- Mobile app architecture, navigation
- Data flow between components

The most common use case I've found mentioned is "Design a card issuing system using a 3rd party API that will handle card printing and delivering."

From what I understand, while mobile app architecture will be discussed, the main focus will be on backend system design. 

What was your experience? What other use cases did you encounter? Any specific areas I should focus on in my preparation?
